\begin_layout Abstract
The advancements in Brain Computer Interface (BCI) open up the promise of
 locomotion to individuals who have lost either movement through disease
 or injury.
 As this technology becomes more advanced, it will allow users an unprecedented
 level of control of electronic devices.
 This paper explores the acquisition of Electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals
 and the techniques for mapping them to movement.
 Particularly looking at the BCI Competition IV dataset 5, where finger
 position is predicted from ECoG signals.
 A comparison of machine learning techniques is made, with analysis of the
 winnerâ€™s methods.

Introduction

\begin_layout Subsection
Brain Computer Interface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Electroencephalography (EEG) is commonly known for its use in measuring
 brain waves.
 By placing electrodes on the surface of the head, it is possible to detect
 the agregate activity of neurons as they fire electrochemical pulses in
 the cortex.
 Because the skull acts to insulate and diffuse the electrical activity
 of the brain, EEG has issues with a low signal to noise ratio.
 It is further limited to measuring the activity of neurons that send pulses
 perpendicular to the surface of the scalp.
 Despite this issues, it is still possible to infer brain states from the
 frequency and phase relationships of the electrodes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alternatively it is possible to place electrodes directly into the brain
 and get readings from individual or small groups of neurons.
 This has been done in animal models, but overtime as the electrodes move,
 scar tissue will build up and the system will become unreliable.
 ECoG occupies a middle ground between the limited information content of
 EEG and the biomaterial challenges of buried electrodes.
 The electrodes are placed directly on the surface of the cortex where it
 is possible to get a strong signal and good spatial resolution.
 This can be used for finding the source of epileptic fits and while the
 array of electrodes are present BCI the patients participate in BCI experiments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
BCI has many potential applications.
 EEG is well known for measuring the brain waves associated with sleep and
 wakefulness.
 It has traditionally been used in medicine and neuroscience but is also
 being used commercially.
 EEG can be used to improve marketing campaigns, architectural design, in
 artistic pieces, and even improve the mindset of athletes.
 ECoG has all the applications of EEG but does require brain surgery, therefore
 in the near term its use will be limited to individuals with damaged nervous
 systems and missing limbs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
BCI Tools
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given that access to EEG technology and good practice with EEG technology
 was neither the goal of this project nor a viable option, two programs
 were used to simulate EEG tests and signals.
 The two programs used are BCI2000 and bcilab.
 Both programs work with Matlab for signal processing.
 Bcilab is a Matlab toolbox.
 The idea behind it is that EEG data can be processed using this program
 in matlab.
 It was intended to help facilitate research into BCI.
 BCILAB 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

works by essentially receiving stimulus from a user and predicting what
 the user is thinking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
BCI2000 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "schalk2004bci2000"

\end_inset

was another program that was intended to create an interface with the human
 brain.
 Since, we had no access to EEG technology, simulations were used in BCI2000.
 In the simulation, there is a ball and a rectangle on opposite sides of
 the screen.
 The objective of the test is supposed to be that a person connected to
 the BCI through an EEG rig tries to make the ball move to and make contact
 with the rectangle.
 Each run simulated 18 different trials, some trials were successful, others
 failed.
 At the the end of each run, a complete log of the number of failed and
 successful attempts is shown along with the number of transferred bits.

 The ECoG, working through an array of electrical potential sensors, records
 different outputs at each sensor in a matrix.
 Subjects connected to the ECoG rig perform a simple movement(for the competitio
n they were instructed to flex a particular finger).
 The movement is supposed to last a specific amount and then the subject
 is supposed to rest for a period of time.
 This allows the BCI to distinguish between different signals.
 It takes a number of trials for the BCI to be trained so that it can distinguis
h the test movement from the other signals picked by the ECoG.
 After the BCI has been trained, testing can begin to determine if it can
 match the same movement from the subject.
 The signals were recorded at 1kHz with a bandpass filter from .15 to 200Hz
 using the BCI2000 software.
 The dataglove was recorded at 25Hz.
 400 seconds of data was given to competition participants.

\begin_layout Subsection
Machine Learning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Machine learning is a broad set of techniques used for interpreting and
 modeling data.
 To create a model that will map ECoG data to finger capture data, the general
 workflow is to start with the raw signal and convert it to a time varying
 feature vector.
 This step should reduce the dimensionality of the data, to speed up the
 next step.
 Often the goal after creating a feature vector would be to classify the
 data.
 In this case we will use linear regression to map the feature to the digit
 positions.
 The standard way to validate that a machine learning technique has been
 successful is to break the data into a training set and a testing set,
 so that the model tested on data that it was not fitted to.

Proir Work

\begin_layout Standard
Five winners were chosen that had the best correlation when their model
 was applied to the test with unknown digit positions.
 In the implementation we present, our methods are based on the winners,
 the Cortex Team 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 They based their methods on the theory that the cortex uses a form of amplitude
 modulation to encode information, and to extract useful features they used
 a equiripple Finite Impulse Response (FIR) band pass filter separate the
 signals into bins of 1-60Hz, 60-100Hz and 100-200Hz and then they computed
 the power of the signal over 40ms windows.
 The original signal was sampled at 1kHz and the data glove was sampled
 at 25Hz, so by combining 40 samples of the ECoG data, the two signals had
 matching time steps.
 Finally having created three feature vectors for each channel, they used
 a stepwise feature selection process, to additively create a set of features
 to perform linear regression on.
 They searched for the best feature to add and continued until the correlation
 on test was not longer increasing or until a threshold of cycles was reached.
 To find the regression, they used the Wiener model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other winners used various methods.
 For creating features, Auto Regression coefficients on a moving window,
 band power from Wavelets, Power Spectrum Density and time-domain average
 of low frequency bandpass.
 To create a model they used, Ridge Regression, Sparse Linear Regression,
 Support Vector Regression, and a Directed Acyclic Graph-Support Vector
 Machine.

For this paper we decided to attempt and reproduce the results of the Cortex
 Team.
 The scripts were created in MATLAB and took advantage of itâ€™s libraries.
 The first task was to create feature vectors from the ECoG channels, we
 used two separate methods for this.
 In the first method we used Welchâ€™s power spectrum density estimate and
 summed the density over different bins, the ones they used and also alternative
s.
 Welchâ€™s method uses FFT over subintervals and calculates an average, the
 resulting data for one frame can be seen in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Spectra-for-one"

\end_inset

.
 Calculating this for all the data points was time consuming.
 The other method was faster and based off of their methods, to use a filter
 to seperate the channels into band limited signals and then to find the
 power of each as the sum of squares.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, having created multiple feature vectors per channel, the task was
 to prune the number of features to be used in the final regression.
 This was done by finding a regression of each feature vector with the finger
 position and creating a list of those features with the best R^2 value.
 The top features were then combined for a final regression to determine
 the coefficients for each feature vector.
 After this it is possible to predict the finger position with the test
 data and compare the results to the actual finger position.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An additional issue when determining the best features to use, was also
 to find the appropriate delay to use.
 The data glove data was recorded with a delay of 37ms and the brain itself
 is active before the finger is moved.
 An estimate of appropriate delays can be gathered from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "wang2009predicting"

\end_inset

 where the experimenters were attempting to predict movement direction.
 The study found that features varied between subjects with the time delay
 ranging from 180 to 510 ms.
 This was incorporated into our work by finding the best performing delay
 for each feature.

Results 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The winning entry performed ith a correlation of .46 on the training data.
 The implementation that we put together was at best able to perform with
 a correlation of .4 as can be seen in table 1.
 However the remaining fingers were not included because the results were
 poor, and to save computation time.
 A more comprehensive comparison would require that the method be applied
 to the other two subjects (there were 3 sets of data from different patients).
 The predicted finger position can be seen in

Comparing the different configurations, we find that the bins used in the
 third Power Spectrum Density feature create the best results, however to
 be thorough it would be necessary to compare the methods on each subject
 and with the full range of data including each finger.

\begin_layout Section
Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is an interesting theoretical question what the best performance that
 could be achieved with this data would be.
 It is worth noting that the electrodes are placed differently on each subject
 and that the recording will be including signals that are unrelated to
 the finger movements.
 In each case, electrodes were positioned over the parietal cortex, which
 is associated with motor control, however neuroscience is not at the point
 where it can solve the inverse problem of determining what signals are
 corresponding to in regard to neural processing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The winning solution obviously performed better than our implementation
 and in further work it would be interesting to determine what changes could
 be made to approach that level of correlation across all the data sets.
 One potential source of difference is in the FIR filter that is used, they
 did not specify the parameters and these were chosen without testing different
 possibilities.
 One interesting direction of further research would be to add meta-learning
 to the program so that various parameters could be optimized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally other research has shown that unsupervised learning may be useful
 in the creation of features.
 In one paper 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 they compared the Band power features to a method based on prior supervised
 convolutional stacked auto-encoders.
 However this method is much more complex.
