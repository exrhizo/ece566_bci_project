-Feature Extraction and Fitting-
================================
**********
* Source *
**********
re-reference with Common Average Reference (CAR)
convert time series ECoF into Freq. domain using autoregressive model - order 50
spectral amplitudes into 1 Hz Bins
Correlation-based Feature Selector (CFS) in Weka -> 5-20 features
fit linear model for x, y, dx, dy
Also looked at cosine tuning

Band decompisition
Sub bands               (1-60 Hz)
Gamma band              (60-100 Hz)
Fast gamma band         (100-300 Hz) actually only up to 200
Ensemble depolarization (300-6000 Hz) not used for this study

Sanchez proposes band-specific AM
Time bins 25ms of sum of band specific power
  power from equiripple finite impulse response FIR
Feature selection by train and validation
fit linear model using Wiener solution
